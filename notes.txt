Notes

#Reading encoders: 
The encoder value for ~1 rotation on right wheel is consistently around 1960. Left wheel is about 1950.
Could use some further testing.
This is about half of the  3591.84 counts per revolution that the spec mentions in the data sheet.  This could make sense, as we only count up for one encoder.
